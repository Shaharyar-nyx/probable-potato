Where applicable, we and the social media site(s) have entered into an arrangement which determines our respective responsibilities.</li><li><strong>Posting on the Services:</strong> Cyberbay may offer publicly accessible pages, blogs, private messages, or community forums. You should be aware that, when you disclose information about yourself in on Cyberbay's pages, blogs, private messages, and community forums, the Cyberbay Services will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any personal information.

Any personal information that an alumnus submits to us will only be used to maintain contact with that alumnus, and will not be disclosed to any third party without your express permission.</li></ul><p><strong>Automatic Data Collection:</strong> We may collect certain information automatically through our Cyberbay Services or other methods of web analysis, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, Advertiser ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Cyberbay Services, and other actions taken through use of the Cyberbay Services such as preferences.</p><p><strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information:</strong> We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Cyberbay Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Cyberbay Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p><p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Cyberbay Services may not work properly.</p><p><strong>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons:</strong> A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Cyberbay Services that collects information about users' engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.</p><p><strong>Embedded Scripts:</strong> We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an embedded script. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Cyberbay Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.</p><p><strong>Social Media Widgets:</strong> Our Website includes social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content.

This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Cyberbay and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Cyberbay Services.</p><p>We may also collect personal data indirectly, such as using cookies. For more information on our use of cookies, please refer to Cookies section.</p><p>It is our policy that you are only required to supply us with the minimum scope of personal information that is necessary for us to complete your request and/or to provide you our Cyberbay Services (“Necessary Personal Information”).

As indicated in 2.1 above, we may however collect certain categories of personal data, which may be regarded as sensitive personal data under relevant laws in Mainland China for purposes of conducting pre-engagement checks and for security purposes (granting access to our premises).</p><p>We will not collect and process your sensitive personal data unless we have obtained your explicit consent as may be required under applicable law.</p>"
